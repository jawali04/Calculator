# Calculator
OVERVIEW:

A front-end calculator is a web-based application that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It is designed using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality. The interface includes a display screen and buttons for digits and operations. JavaScript handles input validation, calculations, and dynamic updates to the display, ensuring a responsive and intuitive user experience. This project showcases skills in front-end development, including user interface design and interactive programming.
